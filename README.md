Amazon Automation with Docker, Selenium Grid, Git, and Jenkins
This repository contains an automation script written in Java using Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with the Amazon application. The script is designed to be run using Docker with Selenium Grid, integrated with Git for version control, and Jenkins for continuous integration.

Prerequisites
Before running the automation script, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
Docker
Git
Jenkins
Selenium WebDriver
GeckoDriver for Firefox (for the provided code snippet)
ChromeDriver for Chrome (if using Chrome)
EdgeDriver for Edge (if using Edge)

Configure Selenium Grid with Docker:
Set up Selenium Grid using Docker. Refer to the Selenium documentation for instructions on setting up Selenium Grid with Docker.
Update WebDriver Configurations:
Update the WebDriver configurations in the provided Java code according to your Selenium Grid setup. This may include specifying the IP address and port of the Selenium Grid hub.
Run the Automation Script Locally:
Execute the automation script locally to ensure it works as expected. You may need to adjust the script to handle different browser configurations.
Push Code to GitHub:
